//**Question 4: Dhaka CNG Fare Meter · 15 marks
//Write a function getCngFare(distance, isNight, waitingMinutes) that returns the total fare in taka.
//Fare rules:
//The minimum fare is 50 taka, and it covers the first 2 km.
//Every km after the first 2 km costs 15 taka.
//Waiting charge: 2 taka for every waiting minute.
//At night, the driver adds 20% on the whole fare — that means on the distance charge and the waiting charge together.
//isNight should default to false and waitingMinutes should default to 0, so getCngFare(5) must work on its own. 
// */
